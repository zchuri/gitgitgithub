title: "Beyond local"
---

Remote repositories are copies of your Git repository stored on *servers*, enabling collaboration across teams, locations, and time zones. Unlike centralized systems with a single "source of truth," Git's distributed nature means every developer has a complete copy of the repository history, with remote servers acting as synchronization points.

Overview:

``` bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Send local commits to remote
git push origin main

# Get remote changes
git pull origin main

# Fetch changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Clone existing remote repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

While Git excels at local version control, its capabilities are enhanced when connected to remote repositories. Github fits perfectly as a *server*. GitHub transforms Git's technical remote capabilities into an intuitive, social platform where developers can seamlessly share code, review changes, and collaborate at scale.

GitHub is a great tool for open source projects, but also it allows for personal use with private repositories. Private repos are not only personal, they may have collaborators (of course, invited by the master's). Furthermore, even if you conceive an open source project, you may keep it private initially and eventually you may deploy it public.

# Remote basics

Let's review this:

``` bash
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "your@email"
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Tip: you may use your GitHub's no-reply email (recommended for privacy). And let's add a classic token to connect to the server.

Change (`cd`) or create (`mkdir`) a new directory, then:

``` bash
# Local copy from the server's directory
git clone https://github.com/zchuri/ejemplo123.git
# Create new directory
cd ..
mkdir remoteex
# Move into that directory
cd ejemplo123/
# Check repo's status and history
git status
git log --oneline
```

## Practice

"I hear it, I forget; I see it, I remember; I do it, I understand."

Let's practice a little bit:

``` bash
# Create a branch
git branch <name>

# Switch to Another Branch
git branch        # Branchs list
git checkout <name>

# Delete a branch
git branch -d <name>

# Merge brach
git merge <name>

# Pushing a Branch to Remote
git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

```{=html}
<!--
# New branch
git branch alternative
# Move to that branch
git checkout alternative
# Create and edit new file
touch alternative.txt
gnome-text-editor alternative.txt
# Add and commit
git add alternative.txt
git commit -m 'new alternative file!'
git log
# Return to main and merge
git checkout main
git merge alternative
# Push a branch
git push origin alternative
# Push the merge (the local's current main)
git push
-->
```

## Pull request

`git pull` is a local Git command that fetches updates from a remote repository and immediately merges them into your current branch, synchronizing your local work with the latest remote changes in a single operation. From a single user point of view, this is also helpful, considering you switch sessions or computers.

``` bash
# Return to the previous repo
cd ../../ejemplo123/
git status
# Pull
git pull
```

git branch
git checkout experimental

nano expfile.txt
cat expfile.txt

## Common pitfalls

``` bash
# Problem: meant to create feature branch but committed to main
git add .
git commit -m "New feature"  # Oops!
# Solution: Create new branch with the commit
git branch feature/new-feature
# Reset main back
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Delete commit from main


# Problem: start working on outdated code, then
git push origin feature  # REJECTED - behind remote
# Solution: Always pull first
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-work
# If already happened:
git pull --rebase origin main
# Resolve conflicts, then push


#Problem: Working on main instead of feature branch
# Made multiple commits on wrong branch
# Solution
# 1. Create new branch from current state
git branch feature/work-in-progress

# 2. Reset main back
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main  # Back to remote state

# 3. Cherry-pick commits if needed
git checkout feature/work-in-progress
git log --oneline  # Get commit hashes
git checkout main
git cherry-pick abc123 def456
```
