## Getting Started with GitHub

Although Git precedes GitHub, it may be more useful to start with GitHub because is more user-friendly for beginners. 

### 1. Create a GitHub Account

First of all, you will need a github account.

-   Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
-   Sign up for free

For academic purposes, GitHub offers additional features (https://github.com/education).

Explore the dashboard and your github.com/yourusername site. Explore also the site of someone else.

### 2. Create a new repository

This is an empty repository:

Nevertheless, I suggest you to add some features from the begining. Relevant features to take into account:

- Name: incompatibilities... but names are very [important](https://r-pkgs.org/workflow101.html)
- Description/README
- Licence: depending on the context it may be really important.

### 3. Add new folders/files

Let's add a bit of code:<br>
<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/><br>
<https://github.com/BrainMapINB><br>

- Upload it through the repo's uploader.
- Always follow this basic steps: add -> commit -> push
- Check the commit.

- Add new code to that file. And upload again. Check the commit info.
- Edit some code in that file. And upload again. Check the commit info. Tip: <https://r-graph-gallery.com>
- You may also check the history of the "main". You may view the entire previous version through the "...View file" option.
- Another option would be to create a new branch based on a previous commit. Branches aim alternative or experimental pathways.

- Merging a branch into the main branch is possible through "Compare & pull request". Rebasing instead of merging, will imply discarding the changes added into the main branch after the aforementioned branch.

In general, the GitHub web interface face many limitations and it is very inefficient when considering multiple files. Let's move to integrate the repository with Git commands.
