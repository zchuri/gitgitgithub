## Getting Started with GitHub

Although Git precedes GitHub, it may be more useful to start with GitHub because is more user-friendly for beginners. 

### 1. Create a GitHub Account

First of all, you will need a github account.

-   Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
-   Sign up for free

For academic purposes, GitHub offers additional features (https://github.com/education).

Explore the dashboard and your github.com/yourusername site. Explore also the site of someone else.

### 2. Create a new repository

This is an empty repository:

Nevertheless, I suggest you to add some features from the begining. Relevant features to take into account:

- Name: incompatibilities... but names are very [important](https://r-pkgs.org/workflow101.html)
- Description/README
- Licence: depending on the context it may be really important.
