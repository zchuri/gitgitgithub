title: "Be Git"

Main features of Git:

- Track changes (Version Control)
- Branching and merging
- Stashing
   - Temporal storing changes while working on a
different feature or priority task. You can later retrieve and apply those
changes to your current working environment.
- Collaboration and teamwork (enhanced through GitHub).

How Does Git Work?

- "Unlike many version control systems, Git works with snapshots rather than differences. This means that instead of tracking the difference between two versions of a file, Git captures a complete snapshot of the project’s current state." (Tsitoara, 2024)
- The main feature of Git is its “three states” system, which consists of the working directory (modify), the staging area (add), and the git directory (commit).

The git directory serves as the database where the project’s complete history is stored, and GitHub fits for that.

## First of all: get Git!

- OS: https://git-scm.com/install/
- Initial config:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "your@email"
git config --global credential.helper store
```
Tip: you may use your GitHub's no-reply email (recommended for privacy).

Wait a minute... it's your first time using Bash... are you panicking?... don't worry, it's quite usual... here some tips:<br>
