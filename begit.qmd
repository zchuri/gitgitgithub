Main features of Git:

- Track changes (Version Control)
- Branching and merging
- Stashing
   - Temporal storing changes while working on a
different feature or priority task. You can later retrieve and apply those
changes to your current working environment.
- Collaboration and teamwork (enhanced through GitHub).

How Does Git Work?

- "Unlike many version control systems, Git works with snapshots rather than differences. This means that instead of tracking the difference between two versions of a file, Git captures a complete snapshot of the project’s current state." (Tsitoara, 2024)
- The main feature of Git is its “three states” system, which consists of the working directory (modify), the staging area (add), and the git directory (commit).

The git directory serves as the database where the project’s complete history is stored, and GitHub fits for that.

## First of all: get Git!

- OS: <https://git-scm.com/install/>
- Initial config:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "your@email"
git config --global credential.helper store
```
Tip: you may use your GitHub's no-reply email (recommended for privacy).

Wait a minute... it's your first time using Bash... are you panicking?... don't worry, it's quite usual... here some tips:<br>

Super tip: the tabulator is going to became a good friend!

## First commands:

Change directory with `cd` then:

```bash
# Local copy from the server's directory
git clone https://github.com/zchuri/ejemplo123.git
# Move into that directory
cd ejemplo123/
# Check the status
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```


Make a small change. Then:

```bash
# Check the status
git status
```

``` 
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	example text.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Untracked changes, then use `git add file1 file2 file3`:

```bash
# Add file
git add 'example text.txt'

#git add file.txt          # Add specific file
#git add .                 # Add all changes

# Check the status
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   example text.txt
```

## Commit arise

A `git commit` is a permanent, versioned *snapshot* of a project's entire codebase at a specific point in time, accompanied by metadata including the author's identity (who), timestamp (when), and a descriptive message (what/why) documenting the changes made.

```bash
# Commit
git commit -m "Adding example text file"

# Commit without -m (opens editor)
# git commit --amend -m "Better message"

```

``` 
[main 04cdef8] Adding example text file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 example text.txt
```


Commit anatomy:

```
[Commit Hash: a1b2c3d]
├── Author: Your Name <email@example.com>
├── Date:   Thu Jan 1 12:00:00 2024
├── Message: "Add user login functionality"
└── Snapshot: All files at that moment
```

Some suggestions for clear/efficient messages:

```
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Resolve login page crash
docs: Update installation instructions
style: Format code with prettier
refactor: Simplify data processing
test: Add unit tests for API
```

Some warnings about not clear messages:

```
fix
stuff
updated
blablabla
```

You may be tired, you may be bored, you may be distracted when writting the messages... but keep in mind who's going to read that message (including your future you).

Overview:

```
# Working Directory      Staging Area          Commit
# (untracked/modified)   (git add)            (git commit)
┌─────────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ file1.txt       │────▶│ file1.txt  │────▶│ SNAPSHOT   │
│ file2.txt       │     │            │     │ of staged  │
│ file3.txt       │     │            │     │ files      │
└─────────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘
```

How to see commits:

```bash
# Commit history
git log                 # Full history
git log --oneline       # Compact view
git log --graph         # Visual branch history
git log -p              # Show changes in each commit

# Specific commits
git show 04cdef8        # Specific commit
git show 8ea90d3        # Specific commit
```

## Navigate between versions

The `git checkout` command enables navigation between different states within a Git repository, allowing developers to switch between branches, restore files from previous commits, or temporarily examine historical versions of the codebase without altering the current working state. This command serves as the primary mechanism for traversing the multidimensional timeline of a project's development history.



git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean


git log
git branch new-branch-name
git checkout new-branch-name # switch between branches
git checkout main
git pull origin main # origin stands for the remote server
git merge
git push
