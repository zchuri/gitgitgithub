## Issues

Now we are going to focus on GitHub's issues:

Go to GitHub's repo, then "Issues" (next to Code), then "New Issue". Then you may specify any sort of issue, and you can even tag other users with the @ symbol. In fact, you may directly assign an issue to another user. Labeling the issues is also possible.
