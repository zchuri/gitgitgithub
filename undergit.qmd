Shall we go private?

Let's create a private repo with a inner circle of collaborators.

```bash
# Create a private repo at GitHub
# Change directory and clone it
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/zchuri/private123.git
```
If your credentials or tokens are not stored, git will ask for them.

```bash
cd private123/
touch privatetext.txt
nano privatetext.txt 
git add privatetext.txt 
git commit -m 'Adding some txt file'
git status
git push
```

Refresh the GitHub repo and invite someone else to the stage.

## Issues

Now we are going to focus on GitHub's issues:

Go to GitHub's repo, then "Issues" (next to Code), then "New Issue". Then you may specify any sort of issue, and you can even tag other users with the \@ symbol. In fact, you may directly assign an issue to another user. Labeling the issues is also possible.
